# Conversation Report

## Conversation Types

There are three types of conversation in Moodle:

- Individual - The most expected, user-to-user, conversation style.
- Group - A conversation with more than two people involved.
- Self - A conversation with yourself, more like a notes system.

## Component Information
Conversations can be created within the context of a component, a context other than site-wide. Information regarding these components are listed in the reports table and, if the conversation was created site-wide, will be listed as blank given that there is no such component information available.

If a given contex is provided, to give a clearer indication of the level the component resides, the following context associations are given:

| Context Name      | Context ID | Context Description                                                                   |
